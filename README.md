## Problem Sheets

just take cf and practice min 50-60 problems for that particular algo

- For **problem solving**, take tough problems and give enough time to think — don’t quit early. Solve problems that **feel hard** for you.
- For **speed**, practice easy questions under time constraints (like solving `x` problems in `y` minutes).
