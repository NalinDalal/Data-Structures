- For **problem solving**, take tough problems and give enough time to think — don’t quit early. Solve problems that **feel hard** for you.
- For **speed**, practice easy questions under time constraints (like solving `x` problems in `y` minutes).

when you read the topic, say you took array and gone through all of it's famous algo, just take cf and practice min 50-60 problems for that particular algo

reading some topic:

- start from scratch
- check already present notes
- go through other books you have
- update notes
- solve various problems on the go
